You are not special, Theres no problem you have that someone has not had, is not currently having and will not have in the future

Simple can be harder than complex. You have to work hard to get your thinking clean and make it simple, but its worth it in the end because when you get there, you can move mountains

 Action is both the cause and effect motivation. The more you do, The more you realize you can do and the more you want to do.

You are guaranteed to fail alot of times if you ever want to succeed

Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Being willing is not enough, we must do

God is Good
