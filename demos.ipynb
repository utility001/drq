    "\n",
    "1. **`'r'` (Read Mode):**\n",
    "   - Opens the file for reading.\n",
    "   - The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "   - This is the default mode if no mode is specified.\n",
    "   - If the file does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised.\n",
    "   - Example: `open('file.txt', 'r')`\n",

    "2. **`'w'` (Write Mode):**\n",
    "   - Opens the file for writing.\n",
    "   - If the file already exists, its content is truncated (cleared).\n",
    "   - If the file does not exist, it is created.\n",
    "   - Example: `open('file.txt', 'w')`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`'a'` (Append Mode):**\n",
    "   - Opens the file for writing.\n",
    "   - The file pointer is placed at the end of the file, preserving the existing content.\n",
    "   - If the file does not exist, it is created.\n",
    "   - Example: `open('file.txt', 'a')`\n",

    "   - If the file does not exist, it is created.\n",
    "   - Example: `open('file.txt', 'x')`\n",

    "5. **`'b'` (Binary Mode):**\n",
    "   - Used in conjunction with other modes to open the file in binary mode.\n",
    "   - Example: `open('file.txt', 'rb')` (read binary), `open('file.txt', 'wb')` (write binary)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`'t'` (Text Mode):**\n",
    "   - Used in conjunction with other modes to open the file in text mode.\n",

    "   - Opens the file for both reading and writing.\n",
